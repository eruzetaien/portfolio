# Gamified Portfolio

**Visit my portfolio: [heshturia.com](http://heshturia.com)**
  
This project explores the idea of mapping personal information into game elements. By gamifying the presentation of data such as personality traits, skills, and projects, the goal is to make the portfolio more engaging for others and more enjoyable to build and maintain as a developer.
